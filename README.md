# Networking

## Networks and Standards:
## 1. Peer-based

#### Purpose of a peer-based network is when a network is created between two or more PCs that are connected and are able to share resources without going through a separate server computer.
#### The benefits of using this type of network is that you do not need an expensive server because individual workstations are used to access the files, there is no need for any specialist staff such as a network technician to set up the server between the PCs and finally if one computer fails it will not disrupt any other part of the network. It just means that those files are not available to other users at that time. The constraints of using this type of network is that each computer might be being accessed by others which can then slow down the performance for the user, files and folders cannot be centrally backed up, there is no security besides the permissions and files are not organised into a specific area so they might be difficult to locate if the computers owner doesn't have a logical filing system. 
#### The resources that are implicated to make a peer-based network is a couple of PC systems that are connected through a broadband/hub connection or connected by Ethernet. These systems communicate through each other usually having a wired connection as it is more stable than having a wireless connection as it might affect the performance of the host user. They are able to send or take files from one PC to another.
#### The communication that is used within a peer-based network is usually through Ethernet which then is connected to a hub which other PCs are connected also to then allow each PC to communicate with one another. This can also be done wirelessly by have a closed connection between each of the computers that will be in the network. 
#### The working practice used in a peer-based network would be on how you will use this in a day to day basis. The Peer-based network would work in certain places such as your home or workplace. For example, if a team working together need to share ideas or designs around they would easily use this network as they are local, also this can be done at home if you have multiple PCs so that you are able to access files from any of your PCs in the house.
#### The Peer-based network is usually used only for smaller companies as using this in large companies would be impractical. But also for smaller companies this could then require a heavy load of cabling, so this should mainly be used for projects and have a certain area so there is not a huge amount of cabling to connect every computer to one another.
#### A peer-based network is very good at allowing information to be shared around as long it is not too big of a network. As to many computers connected all at once might then put more stress on the PCs as there are too many files going back and forth.

## 2. Client-server

#### Purpose of a client-server network is the relationship between two computers in which the client makes a service request from the server. The key point about a client-server is that the client is dependent on the server to provide and manage the information.
#### The benefits of using a client-server network is that all the files are stored in a central location. This allows management of the files to become easier to handle and it will be easier to find files. Backups and network are all controlled centrally, this can be fixed if some sort of break-down and data is lost then this can be easily and efficiently recovered. While in peer-to-peer you would have to do a back-up at every workstation. Users can all access the data centrally and from various platforms in the network. When new information is added it will not affect each workstations storage, as all changes will increase the central server.
#### The resources that are implicated to create a client-server based network is mainly a server to have all the data stored in a central area so that other users may access it. This server then also has to be connected to the internet by any means so that multiple clients/users may access the data within. 
#### To communicate, the client and server must establish a communication session across the network or networks that connect them. Once they establish the connection, the client can call remote procedures in the server as if they were local to the client. 
#### The working practice used in a Client-server network would be on how you will use this in a day to day basis. The Client-server network would work mostly in a workplace and not at home. This is because you might not have the space for theses servers to be setup within your home as huge amount of clients might be attempting to access the server at the same time. The clients would connect from their own personal computers to then connect to the server to access it.
#### This would be used for both medium and small sized companies as it can be useful to have clients observe the service they may be providing or product. This is also good as there won't be that much cabling than in a peer-based network.
#### A client-server network is also good at sharing data/information around and can have a heavy load of users/clients go through and use it at the same time, but if the server is small then it would put more stress on the server as it has to deal with all the clients that are trying to access the server. But if using a bigger server then it would not have any problems.

## 3. Cloud
#### A Cloud network is a term that describes the access of network resources from a centralized third-party provider using a Wide Area Network (WAN) or Internet-based access technologies. Cloud networking is related to the concept of cloud computing, in which centralized computing resources are shared for customers or clients. In a cloud network, the network can be shared as well as the computing resources.
#### There are multiple benefits of using a cloud network. Firstly it is very flexible, for example if your needs increase then you are easily able to increase the cloud capacity and also the same if you want to scale down again, this will allow you to make sure you always have space for more files. Another is that you can work from anywhere when using a cloud network and all you need is an internet connection to allow you to be at work. Disaster recovery is also in cloud networking because if you have a problem within your local area network and all the files and data have been lost you won't have to worry as the cloud network would have it all under there, this allows companies to save tons of money from having a robust disaster recovery. Finally is security, losing your laptop is a huge problem sometimes but a greater loss is losing the sensitive data inside it, cloud networks allow this greater security as all the data is stored in the cloud. So no matter what happens to your machine you will always have your data stored on the cloud and not on your personal laptop.
#### The resources that are used to create a cloud network is a few servers that are then connected to a router which then is connected to the cloud which allows you to store the data and files that you want up in the cloud. For the clients to connect to it they also must have their PC and to be connected to the internet via router which then allows them to connect to it.
#### The way everyone accesses the cloud and communicate to one another is by having a computer that is connected to the internet via router which then allows them to access the cloud network which has been setup by a cloud service provide. This then can allow the user to send files to the cloud and possibly share them to other users.  
#### This would be used by people from home and any company that has setup a cloud network for them. This won't affect in speed or download/upload, the company or the cloud service provider will only have to setup the servers for the cloud network. The work load won't affect the cloud as this is all based on the connection of the router that the person is using.

### 4. Cluster
#### A cluster network is a set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together so that, they can be viewed as a single system. Unlike grid network, cluster network have each node set to perform the same task, controlled and scheduled by software.
#### The benefits of using a cluster network is that firstly it has an increased resource availability, this means that if one intelligence server in the cluster fails then the other servers in the cluster can pick up the workload. Another benefit is strategic resource usage this helps distribute projects across nodes in whatever configuration you prefer. This reduces overhead because not all machines need to be running all projects, and allows you to use your resources flexibly. If you want to increase performance you can have multiple machines connected which provide greater processing power.
#### The resources that are used is several computers that are connected via cabling this is then connected to each and every one of the computers so this makes the network connected to each other.
#### This is usually used in in medium sized businesses as it is more useful for them because if one of the systems shutdown or disconnect then the others will still hold the network together because the other systems are still connected with each other.
