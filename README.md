# Networking

## Networks and Standards:
## 1. Peer-based

#### Purpose of a peer-based network is when a network is created between two or more PCs that are connected and are able to share resources without going through a separate server computer.
#### The benefits of using this type of network is that you do not need an expensive server because individual workstations are used to access the files, there is no need for any specialist staff such as a network technician to set up the server between the PCs and finally if one computer fails it will not disrupt any other part of the network. It just means that those files are not available to other users at that time. The constraints of using this type of network is that each computer might be being accessed by others which can then slow down the performance for the user, files and folders cannot be centrally backed up, there is no security besides the permissions and files are not organised into a specific area so they might be difficult to locate if the computers owner doesn't have a logical filing system. 
#### The resources that are implicated to make a peer-based network is a couple of PC systems that are connected through a broadband/hub connection or connected by Ethernet. These systems communicate through each other usually having a wired connection as it is more stable than having a wireless connection as it might affect the performance of the host user. They are able to send or take files from one PC to another.
#### The communication that is used within a peer-based network is usually through Ethernet which then is connected to a hub which other PCs are connected also to then allow each PC to communicate with one another. This can also be done wirelessly by have a closed connection between each of the computers that will be in the network. 
#### The working practice used in a peer-based network would be on how you will use this in a day to day basis. The Peer-based network would work in certain places such as your home or workplace. For example, if a team working together need to share ideas or designs around they would easily use this network as they are local, also this can be done at home if you have multiple PCs so that you are able to access files from any of your PCs in the house.
#### The Peer-based network is usually used only for smaller companies as using this in large companies would be impractical. But also for smaller companies this could then require a heavy load of cabling, so this should mainly be used for projects and have a certain area so there is not a huge amount of cabling to connect every computer to one another.
#### A peer-based network is very good at allowing information to be shared around as long it is not too big of a network. As to many computers connected all at once might then put more stress on the PCs as there are too many files going back and forth.

## 2. Client-server

#### Purpose of a client-server network is the relationship between two computers in which the client makes a service request from the server. The key point about a client-server is that the client is dependent on the server to provide and manage the information.
#### The benefits of using a client-server network is that all the files are stored in a central location. This allows management of the files to become easier to handle and it will be easier to find files. Backups and network are all controlled centrally, this can be fixed if some sort of break-down and data is lost then this can be easily and efficiently recovered. While in peer-to-peer you would have to do a back-up at every workstation. Users can all access the data centrally and from various platforms in the network. When new information is added it will not affect each workstations storage, as all changes will increase the central server.
#### The resources that are implicated to create a client-server based network is mainly a server to have all the data stored in a central area so that other users may access it. This server then also has to be connected to the internet by any means so that multiple clients/users may access the data within. 
#### To communicate, the client and server must establish a communication session across the network or networks that connect them. Once they establish the connection, the client can call remote procedures in the server as if they were local to the client. 
#### The working practice used in a Client-server network would be on how you will use this in a day to day basis. The Client-server network would work mostly in a workplace and not at home. This is because you might not have the space for theses servers to be setup within your home as huge number of clients might be attempting to access the server at the same time. The clients would connect from their own personal computers to then connect to the server to access it.
#### This would be used for both medium and small sized companies as it can be useful to have clients observe the service they may be providing or product. This is also good as there won't be that much cabling than in a peer-based network.
#### A client-server network is also good at sharing data/information around and can have a heavy load of users/clients go through and use it at the same time, but if the server is small then it would put more stress on the server as it has to deal with all the clients that are trying to access the server. But if using a bigger server then it would not have any problems.

## 3. Cloud
#### A Cloud network is a term that describes the access of network resources from a centralized third-party provider using a Wide Area Network (WAN) or Internet-based access technologies. Cloud networking is related to the concept of cloud computing, in which centralized computing resources are shared for customers or clients. In a cloud network, the network can be shared as well as the computing resources.
#### There are multiple benefits of using a cloud network. Firstly, it is very flexible, for example if your needs increase then you are easily able to increase the cloud capacity and also the same if you want to scale down again, this will allow you to make sure you always have space for more files. Another is that you can work from anywhere when using a cloud network and all you need is an internet connection to allow you to be at work. Disaster recovery is also in cloud networking because if you have a problem within your local area network and all the files and data have been lost you won't have to worry as the cloud network would have it all under there, this allows companies to save tons of money from having a robust disaster recovery. Finally is security, losing your laptop is a huge problem sometimes but a greater loss is losing the sensitive data inside it, cloud networks allow this greater security as all the data is stored in the cloud. So, no matter what happens to your machine you will always have your data stored on the cloud and not on your personal laptop.
#### The resources that are used to create a cloud network is a few servers that are then connected to a router which then is connected to the cloud which allows you to store the data and files that you want up in the cloud. For the clients to connect to it they also must have their PC and to be connected to the internet via router which then allows them to connect to it.
#### The way everyone accesses the cloud and communicate to one another is by having a computer that is connected to the internet via router which then allows them to access the cloud network which has been setup by a cloud service provide. This then can allow the user to send files to the cloud and possibly share them to other users.  
#### This would be used by people from home and any company that has setup a cloud network for them. This won't affect in speed or download/upload, the company or the cloud service provider will only have to setup the servers for the cloud network. The work load won't affect the cloud as this is all based on the connection of the router that the person is using.

### 4. Cluster
#### A cluster network is a set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together so that, they can be viewed as a single system. Unlike grid network, cluster network has each node set to perform the same task, controlled and scheduled by software.
#### The benefits of using a cluster network is that firstly it has an increased resource availability, this means that if one intelligence server in the cluster fails then the other servers in the cluster can pick up the workload. Another benefit is strategic resource usage this helps distribute projects across nodes in whatever configuration you prefer. This reduces overhead because not all machines need to be running all projects, and allows you to use your resources flexibly. If you want to increase performance you can have multiple machines connected which provide greater processing power.
#### The resources that are used is several computers that are connected via cabling this is then connected to each and every one of the computers so this makes the network connected to each other.
#### This is usually used in in medium sized businesses as it is more useful for them because if one of the systems shutdown or disconnect then the others will still hold the network together because the other systems are still connected with each other.

### 5. Centralised
#### A centralised network is a type of network where all users are connected to a central server, which is the acting agent for all communications between. This central server will be then storing both the communications and the user account information. 
#### The benefits of using a centralised network is that there does not need to be many servers that need configurations, it has better management of servers that reduces cost and effort in maintaining it and there is a centralised approach to monitoring, managing, and reducing cost and effort of operations.
#### The resources that are required is a set of computers and a single server, this server is then connected to each of the computers via cabling, this then allows the connection between each of the computers and to the server.
#### The way each of the systems communicate is through the single server that each of the systems are connected to, this server is connected to every system which then allows each of the users to communicate with each other.
#### This is most likely used for small to medium sized businesses that would want to setup a centralised server for projects that the company may do or for having it around the whole company so that there will be less maintenance.


### 6. Virtualised
#### A virtualised network is the process of combining hardware and software network resources and network functionality into a single, software-based administrative entity, a virtual network. 
#### The benefits of using a virtual network are that they are easy to define, this means that they simplify management and access with centralised access control. Another benefit is that you can consolidate hardware by connecting guest systems that run in virtual machines in a single processor. Nothing physical is used with this type of networking and makes it more cost effective, with no need to utilize and maintain, physical switches, routers or servers. In case of a failure or a disaster, the virtualized network gets applications and systems up faster and even such outages can be prevented.
#### This can be used by any type of company no matter what size and can used for anything to help them within the company. 

## Conceptual Models 
#### The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model which is made up of many communication protocols that are used to connect network devices on the internet and this can be also used as a communications protocol within a private network.
#### The TCP/IP model uses the client/server model of communication, this is when a client is given a service that is from another computer that is located on the same network. This model is made up of different protocols which are divided into four layers:

#### Application - This layer is responsible for providing network services to applications. High-level protocols that are included within the application layer, such as DNS, HTTP, FTP, etc.
#### Transport - The transport layer maintains the end-to-end communications within a network. The communications between each of the hosts are handled within this layer. Flow control, multiplexing and reliability are also maintained by the transport layer. Two protocols that are used within this layer are TCP and UDP. TCP is used for delivery of the data successfully and for providing error control, and UDP is used for less extensive control features.
#### Internet - The internet layer also known as the network layer, packs the data into data packets and routes it to the correct device on the network. These packets that are sent acroos then form the IP. These contain the source and destination address that is used to transmit the IPs across networks.
#### Network Access - The final layer is known as the Network Access Layer, that combines the data link and physical layers from the OSI model. It provides a means for the data to be delivered to other devices on a network and defines how the network should transmit an IP. This layer has to understand the details of the underlying network before it can format the data being transmitted.
## OSI Model
#### Application - The application layer in the OSI model is a means for applications to receive network services, basically communicating the services to them such as file transfers and e-mails. Numerous protocols are used within this layer, such as HTTP for web based languages transferred across the network and mail services by the SMTP protocol for email services.
#### Presentation - The presentation layer is used for interpreting the data and then transforming that the application layer can use it later on. Many file types are represented by the application and can be converted, encrypted, decrypted or compressed.
#### Session - The session layer establishes connections between applications and can set up, coordinate and terminate the conversations that happens between them. The protocols used are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol), which are commonly provided within most applications.
#### Transport - This layer provides the transportation of data between hosts or end systems and is responsible for error recovery and flow control. TCP and UDP protocols, used in the session layer, provide these services through the internet for most applications.
#### Network - The network layer handles the addressing and routing of data, where it is sent to the correct destination, selecting the appropriate routes and forwarding the data to the transport layer. The protocols that map to the OSI network include the IP protocol from the TCP/IP model, both IPv4 and IPv6, as well as Interwork Packet Exchange (IPX).
#### Data Link - The data link layer is responsible for encoding the data prior to the transmission and decoding the data back into the bits at the destination, mainly handling the data transfer out of a physical link. This layer divides itself into two sub-layers; Media Access Control which is how the computer gains access to the data and the permission to transfer said data, and the Logical Link Control which controls the frame synchronisation, flow control and error checking.
#### Physical - The last layer is the physical layer that conveys the bit stream across the network. This is done via electrical impulse, light or a radio signal. A variety of devices and mediums are covered, through cables, cards and other ports.

### Comparison of the two models
|TCP/IP|OSI|
|------|---|
|Has 4 layers within the model.|The OSI model has 7 layers.|
|Follows a horizontal approach.|Follows a vertical approach.|
|TCP/IP model is more lenient in terms of boundaries.|The OSI model has strict boundaries.|
|In the TCP/IP model the transport layer does not guarantee the delivery of packets.|The OSI models transport layer guarantees the delivery of packets.|
|TCP/IP can only support connectionless communication from the network layer.|OSI can support both connectionless and connection-oriented communication within the network layer.|
|The model doesn’t clearly differentiate between services, interfaces and protocols.|Within the OSI there is a clear distinction between the services, interfaces and protocols.|
|TCP/IP is very dependant on protocols.|OSI doesn't depend on protocols.|
|No separate session and presentation layer. The characteristics are provided by the application and transport layer respectively.|OSI model separate presentation and session layer .| 


## Working standards and Protocols

### Physical Cabling and Data Transmission
### IEEE 802.3
#### IEEE 802.3 which is the standard used for Ethernet. This standard is used to determine the physical connection within a local area network (LAN), this can also be used within (WAN) set-ups. This is of course maintained by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The communication standards for ethernet connections and cables are updated regularly adding additional features however 802.3 was the first IEEE standard to be implemented. This standard is essentially specifying the physical cables and the working characteristics of Ethernet. The speeds of these connections that are described on this standard must be at speed of 10Mbps.

### IEEE 802.7
#### This standard is a sub-standard of the IEEE 802 which is recommended for broadband LAN connections. The items that are specified with the standard are the design, installation and the test parameters for the broadband cable medium that is used within the network.

### IEEE 802.8
#### The IEEE 802.8 standard which is referred to the standard of fibre optic connections is used in token passing computer networks. This is used in the same group as the previous standards and has some of the defining features within. This essentially gives the recommendations for configuration and testing of fibre optic however is called a standard by itself as it covers a different connection type.

### IEEE 802.11
#### IEEE 802.11 is referred to the set of standards that define communication in wireless connections. This includes the most popular form of connection Wi-Fi and is used mainly as a set of guidelines that is for implementing Wi-Fi to a network. This standard is used to outline the types of frequencies that are being used when using access points and other network devices.

### Routed Protocols
#### Routed protocols are protocols that are used to route data from one network to another. These protocols have an addressing system that is used to address a particular network or host. 

#### IPv4 which was one of the core protocols within standard-based interworking methods on the internet. This IP version 4 was thought to have enough addresses but due to the population of the world which has drastically increased and the amount of devices that have been manufactured for more actives users, which then meant that there was not enough IPv4 addresses to assign. IPv6 which was introduced to create considerable amount of addresses to fulfil the requirement needed which has more than 4 billion which IPv4 had. Global Unicast which is a feature in IPv6 that is a routable address that can be used on the internet that uses a single node. The main problem with global unicast is that when the data packets are sent they are not actually sent to one target destination. When the data packet that is supposed to be sent off to a single destination, is then sent to all hosts as a broadcast packet making this protocol a potential security risk.

#### Link local is an IPv6 unicast address that is only effective for communications within the link or the broadcast domain where the host is connected. This address is not unique beyond a single link and routers cannot forward the packets that have a link-local address. A Unique Local Address (ULA) is an address that is used in IPv6 as an identifier. The only problem is that data is not meant to be routed outside of the specified range and should not be allocated by an address registry. The EUI 64 (Extended Unique Identifier) which is a format that allows a host to automatically assign itself a unique 64-bit IPv6 interface identifier, which eliminates the need to manually configure the IP or to used DHCP in IPv4 addresses. This is a benefit of IPv6's over IPv4 is the capability for automatic interface addressing. The problem that appears from using this that privacy loss would be a potential concern, with the MAC address of the router being revealed. Auto-configuration is another important features in IPv6 that allows devices to automatically configure themselves and to use the internet without requiring any DHCP support making it good for applications to require a secure connection without the DHCP server. 

## Services and network applications: 
### FTP
#### File transfer protocol or FTP, is a protocol that focuses on transmitting files between two networks over TCP/IP. This type of protocol relies of two communication channels which is a server and a client who is then able to edit multiple files using FTP, the client is also able to upload, download and delete files on the server. In order to use FTP there must be some servers that can be logged into in order to gain access to the files transferred.

### HTTP
#### Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP is the protocol that is used by the World Wide Web. This protocol governs the actions in which web servers or browsers should take in from the user's commands in order to respond. HTTP is used to display the webpage to the user and provide with the visual representation of that webpage, and also helps handle the display and format to allow a much faster load time. 

### SMTP
#### SMTP or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, which is a protocol that us used for emailing messages to other users on different servers. This protocol is used to connect servers that allows messages that clients can send from one to another.

### POP3
#### POP3 or Post Office Protocol, is a protocol in which allows clients to receive emails. The most recent version is POP3 in which the email is held for the user by the internet server and once the mail is downloaded, it can be deleted, though it can still be saved for a period of time. This protocol has many updates and within each of the updates it allows more features to make it much easier to handle emails for the clients and easier in receiving emails.

### SSL
#### Secure Sockets Layer or SSL, is a security technology standard that allows encrypted linking between web servers and browsers. This standard ensures that the more sensitive data is transmitted securely, this includes information such as credit card numbers, account credentials.

## The Impact of networking topology, communication and bandwidth
### Network Topology
#### Network topologies are the rules by which different networks are designed. Logical topologies are concepts that specify the architecture of the communication of nodes in a network. The topology of a network can be dynamically maintained and reconfigured by routers and switches. This is mainly specifying on how the signals act on the network media and how the data passes through the network to the devices. Ethernet is a good example that is based on a type of logical topology which is known as the bus topology.

#### The physical topology assigns to the actual structure of a Local Area Network. This utilises various network cables that then are connected to the physical devices that are on the network. This physically lays it out for the organisation of a network. This usually requires a lot of planning by determining the cable to be used and how they it runs through the building.

#### 1. The mesh topology, this is where multiple connections are made between multiple systems and are all connected to each system that is on the network, this means that if one fails the other systems will use different routes on the network to connect to another system.

#### 2. The ring topology, this is where all the systems in the network have been arranged into a circular formation. This means that each device is connected to two other devices on the network the data packets travel around these systems until it reaches its destination. 

#### 3. The star topology, this topology is where all the machines are connected to a single hub or sometimes a switch at the centre of the network. This is why it has the name star network, as the connections branch out to give the look of a star. So, if the central hub fails no systems can communicate with one another.

#### 4. The bus topology, is a common topology where every single component within the network are all connected on a straight line and are terminated on both end. This creates a stress on the single connecting line as most files would be transmitted through that line which will be a heavy load.

#### 5. A tree topology is a combination of a star network topology and a bus topology. In a tree topology, nodes of the underlying bus network topology are replaced with a complete star topology which then creates a tree like topology.


## Network Communication

#### Communication is the transmission of data from one system to another, this can be a mobile device or a computer, the transmission is usually over a network set-up by a company. When browsing the internet, the most common process that is used is data transmission between the user and the server, for example, sending an email to another user or retrieving a file from the internet. However, if a user would want to use the internet, then they would have to acquire a connection that will allow them to use the internet. Devices such as a router or a modem are used to connect to a network, this then allows the communication with the internet.

#### Data is transmitted all the time through networks, but this data flowing through can be vulnerable to malicious attacks from hackers that try to gain information from users. Security measures must be put into place such as firewalls or anti-virus software into a network. This then protects the network from any types of attacks, so the firewall will stop any file that does not belong within the network trying to gain access but also if one does get through the anti-virus software will prevent the malicious attack from spreading around and damaging the network.

## Network Bandwidth
#### Communication also happens within a network model, for example, TCP/IP model has an application layer which allows services to be requested from a user to the application. This means that the data is ready to be sent, but waits as the communication is not focused in this layer but instead the transport and internet layer. The transport layer handles the communication between each of the host so that there will be a successful delivery between then. The internet layer sends this data across to the correct host and not to other hosts that may be requesting the same service. Each of these layers aid the communication of data successfully by having the data transfer monitored and to make sure that the communication is with the correct host. All communication channels within any networking model have limited frequency bandwidth, these limited frequencies are down to the properties of the channel so that it may prevent any interference from other sources. Since the frequencies are limited the bandwidth cannot be maximised to its full potential and can cause problems, for example when having low bandwidth, it can reduce speed in both browsing and downloading/uploading, making a huge congestion of data being blocked.


## Operating principles of Networking
### Networking Devices
### Hubs
#### Hubs serve as a central connection point for devices within a network and can be either wireless or wired. These are used to manage and route traffic over local connections, however this data is sent one packet at a time so that all users do not recieve a copy. It usually contains multiple ports so that it is able to connect with a variety of devices.

### Routers
#### Routers are electronic devices that are able to connect multiple computer networks and then are able to receive, analyse and move incoming packets of data to another network. The data that is sent off runs through a number of network points with other routers before it reaches its destination. Routers are also able to determine the best route for packets of data to travel on.

### Switches
#### Switches are devices that are able to receive incoming data packets and then redirect them to the correct destination within a LAN. This also creates an electronic tunnel that allows only the traffic that is requested, so whilst the data is being transmitted, no other packets can enter which then allows communication without any collisions.

### Multilayer Switch
#### A multilayer switch is a device that is similar to a switch however it can operate better and on higher levels than a traditional switch, performing the same functions but at a faster rate. Higher level functions were added to the switch which allows it to look into the packets of data to then help forwarding that data to its correct location

### Firewall
#### Firewalls have the functional software that protects different packets and also blocking malicious packets from entering a system. It enforces a set of rules for what traffic can enter or leave a network. The firewall is placed to filter the amount of traffic from entering and have a set of requirements to enter and if they are not met, then the firewall will block these packets that do not meet them.

### HIDS
#### HIDS or Host-Based Intrusion Detection System, is a system which specialises for overseeing internal components in a system in order to detect for an intrusion. This system analuses traffic on the computer that has it installed and reports any malicious packets that are entering or exiting the network.

### Repeaters
#### A repeater is a device that is within a network that is used to repair or replicate signals that have been distorted from any electromagnetic interference. This can also relay messages between subnetworks using different protocols and cables, it can also strengthen signals on networks which can extend the LAN beyond its limits. 

### Bridges
#### Network bridges provide interconnection with other bridge networks that also use the same protocol. These are mainly used in LANs because of how they are able to block up large networks because of their ability to then transmit the data to all the nodes within that network. Bridges also use a database to determine where the the data frame can pass, transmit or be discarded.

### Access Point
#### An Access Point is a station that provides users with a wireless connection to a wired network. Wireless access point are the most common, such as Wi-Fi which allows users to connect to the network remotely. It can provide connectivity to anyone in the network anywhere and remain connected to that network.

### Content Filter
#### Content filtering is a simple concept, it uses a pre-determined set of rules to prevent and exclude any data that is considered spam or malicious. This is mainly used for security purposes so that it prevents network users from connection to websites that have malicious software on it. Email servers commonly use content filters to filter spam emails.

### Load Balancer
#### Load balancer is a software that is used to distribute the workload over an entire network. This maximises speed and efficieny by having the traffic requests routed across servers to then ensure that none of them overload with traffic. Each new server that is added, the balancer then sends the requests to it automatically so other do not overload.

### Modem
#### A modem is a device that is used for trasmitting data over a cable or telephone connection. The modem is so called because it modulates or demodulates analogue signal simultaneously to digital signal for a computer to recognize and vice versa for other devices.

### Packet Shaper
#### A packet shaper are used to prioritise certain data being sent over a network. This is used to regulate the data that is transferred to maintain a level of performance and quality. It delays the packets of data that is considered as less important for more prioritized traffic, such as instant messages to wait to be sent whilst more important datalike security information is sent. 

### VPN Concentrator
#### A VPN concentrator is a network device that provides a secure connection and delivery of data between VPN nodes. It adds to the capabilities of a VPN, allowing for many people to access the VPN at the same time.

## Server types
### Web
#### A web server stores and delivers data or services on websites over the internet. Once a user has made a request to the web server, it then takes the relevant HTML page sending it to the users web browser. Any computer system can be used as web server via server software and the internet, so that it can provide the services such as software and commercial packages. Thousands of request can be handles by a web server at any given time.

### File
#### A file server is responsible for the storage and management of data files for users on the network to access. The data that is stored within the file server can range from public data in which anyone is able to access on the network, to then private data which only a specific set of user/s are able to access. 

### Database
#### A database server is a type of server that stores data in certain catagories or fields. The data that is stored on these servers are only related to one another so that if a request is made it will only show information about that certain subject. For example, if you scan an item at a shop, the system will then access the database and retrieve the data that is related to that item.

### Combination
#### A combination server is a type of server combines the functions of three different servers, which are a web, file and database server. Combining all three fulfil the functions of all the performing above tasks on a single server. 

### Virtualisation
#### A virtualised server is a server that was at once physical, but broken up into small virtual servers assisted by software. These servers provide web hosting, file or database services but this is masked as small individual servers so there is less hardware from a physical server.

### Terminal Services
#### Terminal services is a device that allows other computers that are connected to these devices with a path to another LAN or WAN, using this, the clients systems do not have to be connected to a router to make the connection.

## Interdependence of Workstation hardware 
### Networking Software
#### Networking software determines what is needed to create and maintain a network, regardless if it is LAN or WAN. Here are some examples of what is needed to create a network:

### Client Software
#### A client is a common term for any piece of software that is on a clients machine which performs that specific task. For example, Microsoft Word is a piece of client software. The software provides the means for the user to input and edit data or to make requests on the network depending on the type of software.

### Server Software
#### Server software is usually used on servers to perform a certain task for that server. Depending on the type of software that is installed on the server it then dictates what purpose it has. The different tasks that a server can perform includes web hosting, file transfer and acting as a dedicated email server.

### Client Operating System
#### Client operating system is a software that is installed on clients systems that has a function that allows it to operate on its own and complete its own functions. This can improve productivity with the system and can allow the system complete more tasks, for example web browsing. Operating systems can provide the clients computer with a more detailed and broad user interface to enable the user to use the computer as efficiently as possible.

### Server Operating system
#### This operating system has the same conceopt as a client operating system, the different being that the server operating system allows different types of features to help the server function effectively. For example, this can help the server perform actions such as packet handling so the server does not get overwhelmed.

### Firewall
#### A firewall is a piece of software that determines what data can access a network by opening and closing different ports. A firewall is one of the main security protocols that are used to keep networks secure, since the system itself is unable to analyse incoming data and detect a threat, the set of rules that are put in place within the software so that it is more difficult for viruses to access the network as there are not many way into the system. This can help reduce the workload placed on dedicated anti-virus software.

### Proxies
#### Proxy servers are servers that are able to handle web requests for any users connected to the server. Usually every user would have to make a request directly to the web server, however when a proxy server is set-up, the user tells the proxy to make a request for it, then the proxy will make the request for the user as instructed. The proxy server is able to check incoming data before it reaches the user, if the server finds anything malicious or something that is banned on the network, the proxy will then deny the request.


### Network Comparison
#### A network card is a device that is used to connect a computer to a computer network, to do this the card is able to exchange data using a suitable protocol to then gain a stable connection to the network. Wireless networks are networks that do not rely on any cabling but instead radio waves and is able to connect via Wi-Fi hotspots. Mobile or a cellular network is a network that is distributed through cells where each cell has a fixed transceiver or base station. 
 
#### A network card would be the only network that would require a wired input to connect, the way they connect it is through a coaxial or ethernet port, so in contrast with the other networks there is no form of wireless output for connecting to a network. But the difference between a wireless network is that it uses radio waves within the network whereas mobile devices require a dedicated control channel for transmitting digital information. So, the comparison with mobile and in comparison, to all three is that mobile phone can only use a mobile network, as mobiles manipulate the frequencies for better connection to the network.

### Cabling Used
#### Structured cabling is a system of cabling and hardware that allow comprehensive communications infrastructure. This is a main organised approach to a cable network and most of the elements of the network are done within the hardware, rather than using multiple cables. Network cables are a piece of hardware that are used for connecting one device to another and is used to transmit data between routers, computers, switches and storage networks. There are many different types of network cables, which have different ports that they connect to and cabling types. The most common types of cabling are:

#### 1. Patch cables, these are ethernet cables that are used ti link a computer to a hub, switch or router, or even the possibility to other devices. These kinds of cables are used to connect home networks and small business networks as their length can be limiting, this means that they are much better at transferring data between two devices than other cables.
#### 2. Shielded cables, are the same as patch cables but instead they are composed of insulated conductors that are enclosed within the conductive layer, which can be either copper or aluminium. This shielding that allows the signal to stay strong over a longer distance and it also protects against interference.
#### 3. Twisted pair cables are two copper cables intertwined within the same wire. This allows for less crosstalk or possibly any form of electromagnetic interference when transferring data, this can protect any packets that might be lost due to the interference.

### Permissions
#### Permissions are a security protocol that is used to help keep out unwanted packets or data, this is given to users or network administrators to define the rights to certain files on a network. The way this works is that the different users of each of the end systems or networking devices are able to set their own permissions and requirement for entry, these are usually set through admin privileges on different devices as it is the primary security protocol that allows unwanted data to be transferred. Here are two different forms of permissions that can be installed within a network or device:

### NTFS
#### NTFS is a form of permissions that are used for determining access to files and folders that are features commonly seen in Microsoft Windows. This permission allows for users who have the accessibility to gain full control over the files, they are able to read, write, edit and/or delete files when given the opportunity. NTFS has very flexible options as it means that users can be assigned specific functions, which makes it more organised and it also ensures that higher level access isn’t given to a huge number of users.

### Shared Permissions
#### Shared permissions are similar to NTFS however these are set for shared folders within a network. These permissions can determine the different levels of security and access which can only allow the selected people to view higher prioritised folders, which also depends of the levels of access they have. 

### Local Workstation Architecture
#### Workstation computers are specialised computers that are able at completing a set task or tasks at a faster and more capable rate. These machines are very similar to a private home computer however this type of system is always connected onto the LAN that it is under, this allows it to share its resources and also process resources within the LAN network. The specialised computer will usually have a much better processor than on a private computer, this will then allow the workstation to run more tasks and it may also require extra memory and clock speed to support with all the data that will be transferred. Despite being one user only, it can also be remotely accessed by other users over the network. There are many different uses of workstation computers, however they can be quite costly in order to obtain.

### System Bus
#### A system bus is a form of a connection that is able to carry data between the microprocessor of the computer and the main memory of the computer, essentially providing a communication pathway for the data between the major components of the computer system. This usually works by having the data carried within the motherboard however can also be carried between the CPU and also other components. The address of the bus is where the data will be sent and will determine the route for the data when sent, the control of the system bus is used to identify the type of operation the data requires when it arrives at its destination. The lines or pins of a bus are as followed:

##### Address – The components pass memory to each other over this bus.
##### Control – This is used to send signals for coordinating and managing the activities of motherboard components.
##### Data – This is transferred between peripherals, memory and the processor.

## Network Design
### Architecture 
#### The requirements that had to be met for the network that i was asked to design were for two LANs, both LANs having 3 PCs, a server and a router. These had pre-configured IP addresses that have to be assigned to each of the PCs, servers and routers. These requirements are then extended to have the two LAN networks become a Wide Area Network(WAN) where the PCs are able to communicate from one network to the other, the other extension was to add a network printer and a wireless access point.

## Implemented System and Justification

#### This was the final system that was built including with the optional requirements such as the printers and wireless access points. The star topology was used in this design because of how the topology allows each of the PCs to get to its destination much faster than going through most of the devices on the network, such as a ring topology. Setting the network up in way allows data to be sent to the destination without any additional copies of that same data. This is a very simplistic topology, which allows the ease of connecting different machines to the system without the rest of the network being affected, since the printer and wireless access point was added whilst the network was still active and running. 

#### The cabling that was used throughout most of the network was copper straight through which was the standard ethernet conneciton between ports. This was chosen firstly since most of the ports on the system did not have a fibre optic port and also because of the cost effectiveness of the connection, despite fibre optic being the more efficient cable and the network being small, the connection is still effective so the need for fibre optic would be wasteful on such a small network. The connection between the two LANs was made through the router and the Serial DTE connection was used to have both of the router connected to then create the WAN out of the two LANs. The DTE connection was chosen over the DCE because of the device types used.

### User Feedback
|Name|Feedback|
|----|--------|
|Luke|Both of the networks work well and are able to connect within their own networks and are also able to connect other networks. No improvements needed.|
|Codrin|The design of the network is very well made, the use of the star topology makes it easier to understand how the network works and this also allows the data to transmit much faster and routes to the correct PC.|
### Analysis of Results
#### By looking over all the testing carried out, all of the network features worked perfectly and performed exactly how the expected results would be. There were no failures throughout any of the testing phase, which was a huge achievement as usually there would always be one minor mistake in the creation of a network.
#### The LANs set-up both worked correctly, the first one was created using the requirements and the second was copied but with the requirements of the address changed and the domain names also so that it may function properly. The WAN design and connection worked without any problems and was all successful, which allows the two LANs to join up to then create the Wide Area Network. Also when pinging across networks sometimes the connection would time out, so to make sure that would not happen, the gateway IP was assigned to all PCs on each network and the servers. This allowed for computers across the WAN to communicate effectively and without interruption. The configuration of the DNS server was also perfectly working and also helped in pinging the PCs across both networks much faster, as you won't have to type in the whole IP address. The optional requirements were also carried out and then tested to make sure that they are working, in which they both passed. The access point and the printer connected successfully to the network and working well, without causing any problems with the rest of the network. 

## Evaluation of Network Design
#### The network that i had created and designed has succesfully met the requirements and specifications to a great standard. Many positive choices were made when creating the system, such as ths star topology that was used so that the data can be smoothly sent to the destination for both networks and not to other devices on the network within the WAN. The use of the copper straight-through ethernet connection worked as intended, not as fast as expected but since it is a small sized network, it is cost effective. During the testing phase, the network performed exactly is instended and as expected no errors or bugs were found. Also when adding in the DNS into the network, it was time consuming but once it was set-up it worked perfectly and having each of the PCs ping back exactly as it should and found out that there were no issues with pinging other users via their domain name. Improvements that could be considered to the network would be changing to other topologies that would fit the requirements much better, as other network topolgies have more ways to backup, for exmaple if the switch on the star network fails then everything connected to it cannot communicate with other devices, but if created in a mesh network, one system may fail but the others will still be able to communicate with each other. Overall, the network has met all the targets and does function well for a home or small business, but improvements to the structure of the network would prove for it to function more effectively, as well as ensuring security and better reliability.
