# Networking

## Networks and Standards:
## 1. Peer-based

#### Purpose of a peer-based network is when a network is created between two or more PCs that are connected and are able to share resources without going through a separate server computer.
#### The benefits of using this type of network is that you do not need an expensive server because individual workstations are used to access the files, there is no need for any specialist staff such as a network technician to set up the server between the PCs and finally if one computer fails it will not disrupt any other part of the network. It just means that those files are not available to other users at that time. The constraints of using this type of network is that each computer might be being accessed by others which can then slow down the performance for the user, files and folders cannot be centrally backed up, there is no security besides the permissions and files are not organised into a specific area so they might be difficult to locate if the computers owner doesn't have a logical filing system. 
#### The resources that are implicated to make a peer-based network is a couple of PC systems that are connected through a broadband/hub connection or connected by Ethernet. These systems communicate through each other usually having a wired connection as it is more stable than having a wireless connection as it might affect the performance of the host user. They are able to send or take files from one PC to another.
#### The communication that is used within a peer-based network is usually through Ethernet which then is connected to a hub which other PCs are connected also to then allow each PC to communicate with one another. This can also be done wirelessly by have a closed connection between each of the computers that will be in the network. 
#### The working practice used in a peer-based network would be on how you will use this in a day to day basis. The Peer-based network would work in certain places such as your home or workplace. For example, if a team working together need to share ideas or designs around they would easily use this network as they are local, also this can be done at home if you have multiple PCs so that you are able to access files from any of your PCs in the house.
#### The Peer-based network is usually used only for smaller companies as using this in large companies would be impractical. But also for smaller companies this could then require a heavy load of cabling, so this should mainly be used for projects and have a certain area so there is not a huge amount of cabling to connect every computer to one another.
#### A peer-based network is very good at allowing information to be shared around as long it is not too big of a network. As to many computers connected all at once might then put more stress on the PCs as there are too many files going back and forth.

## 2. Client-server

#### Purpose of a client-server network is the relationship between two computers in which the client makes a service request from the server. The key point about a client-server is that the client is dependent on the server to provide and manage the information.
#### The benefits of using a client-server network is that all the files are stored in a central location. This allows management of the files to become easier to handle and it will be easier to find files. Backups and network are all controlled centrally, this can be fixed if some sort of break-down and data is lost then this can be easily and efficiently recovered. While in peer-to-peer you would have to do a back-up at every workstation. Users can all access the data centrally and from various platforms in the network. When new information is added it will not affect each workstations storage, as all changes will increase the central server.
#### The resources that are implicated to create a client-server based network is mainly a server to have all the data stored in a central area so that other users may access it. This server then also has to be connected to the internet by any means so that multiple clients/users may access the data within. 
#### To communicate, the client and server must establish a communication session across the network or networks that connect them. Once they establish the connection, the client can call remote procedures in the server as if they were local to the client. 
#### The working practice used in a Client-server network would be on how you will use this in a day to day basis. The Client-server network would work mostly in a workplace and not at home. This is because you might not have the space for theses servers to be setup within your home as huge number of clients might be attempting to access the server at the same time. The clients would connect from their own personal computers to then connect to the server to access it.
#### This would be used for both medium and small sized companies as it can be useful to have clients observe the service they may be providing or product. This is also good as there won't be that much cabling than in a peer-based network.
#### A client-server network is also good at sharing data/information around and can have a heavy load of users/clients go through and use it at the same time, but if the server is small then it would put more stress on the server as it has to deal with all the clients that are trying to access the server. But if using a bigger server then it would not have any problems.

## 3. Cloud
#### A Cloud network is a term that describes the access of network resources from a centralized third-party provider using a Wide Area Network (WAN) or Internet-based access technologies. Cloud networking is related to the concept of cloud computing, in which centralized computing resources are shared for customers or clients. In a cloud network, the network can be shared as well as the computing resources.
#### There are multiple benefits of using a cloud network. Firstly, it is very flexible, for example if your needs increase then you are easily able to increase the cloud capacity and also the same if you want to scale down again, this will allow you to make sure you always have space for more files. Another is that you can work from anywhere when using a cloud network and all you need is an internet connection to allow you to be at work. Disaster recovery is also in cloud networking because if you have a problem within your local area network and all the files and data have been lost you won't have to worry as the cloud network would have it all under there, this allows companies to save tons of money from having a robust disaster recovery. Finally is security, losing your laptop is a huge problem sometimes but a greater loss is losing the sensitive data inside it, cloud networks allow this greater security as all the data is stored in the cloud. So, no matter what happens to your machine you will always have your data stored on the cloud and not on your personal laptop.
#### The resources that are used to create a cloud network is a few servers that are then connected to a router which then is connected to the cloud which allows you to store the data and files that you want up in the cloud. For the clients to connect to it they also must have their PC and to be connected to the internet via router which then allows them to connect to it.
#### The way everyone accesses the cloud and communicate to one another is by having a computer that is connected to the internet via router which then allows them to access the cloud network which has been setup by a cloud service provide. This then can allow the user to send files to the cloud and possibly share them to other users.  
#### This would be used by people from home and any company that has setup a cloud network for them. This won't affect in speed or download/upload, the company or the cloud service provider will only have to setup the servers for the cloud network. The work load won't affect the cloud as this is all based on the connection of the router that the person is using.

### 4. Cluster
#### A cluster network is a set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together so that, they can be viewed as a single system. Unlike grid network, cluster network has each node set to perform the same task, controlled and scheduled by software.
#### The benefits of using a cluster network is that firstly it has an increased resource availability, this means that if one intelligence server in the cluster fails then the other servers in the cluster can pick up the workload. Another benefit is strategic resource usage this helps distribute projects across nodes in whatever configuration you prefer. This reduces overhead because not all machines need to be running all projects, and allows you to use your resources flexibly. If you want to increase performance you can have multiple machines connected which provide greater processing power.
#### The resources that are used is several computers that are connected via cabling this is then connected to each and every one of the computers so this makes the network connected to each other.
#### This is usually used in in medium sized businesses as it is more useful for them because if one of the systems shutdown or disconnect then the others will still hold the network together because the other systems are still connected with each other.

### 5. Centralised
#### A centralised network is a type of network where all users are connected to a central server, which is the acting agent for all communications between. This central server will be then storing both the communications and the user account information. 
#### The benefits of using a centralised network is that there does not need to be many servers that need configurations, it has better management of servers that reduces cost and effort in maintaining it and there is a centralised approach to monitoring, managing, and reducing cost and effort of operations.
#### The resources that are required is a set of computers and a single server, this server is then connected to each of the computers via cabling, this then allows the connection between each of the computers and to the server.
#### The way each of the systems communicate is through the single server that each of the systems are connected to, this server is connected to every system which then allows each of the users to communicate with each other.
#### This is most likely used for small to medium sized businesses that would want to setup a centralised server for projects that the company may do or for having it around the whole company so that there will be less maintenance.


### 6. Virtualised
#### A virtualised network is the process of combining hardware and software network resources and network functionality into a single, software-based administrative entity, a virtual network. 
#### The benefits of using a virtual network are that they are easy to define, this means that they simplify management and access with centralised access control. Another benefit is that you can consolidate hardware by connecting guest systems that run in virtual machines in a single processor. Nothing physical is used with this type of networking and makes it more cost effective, with no need to utilize and maintain, physical switches, routers or servers. In case of a failure or a disaster, the virtualized network gets applications and systems up faster and even such outages can be prevented.
#### This can be used by any type of company no matter what size and can used for anything to help them within the company. 

## Conceptual Models 
#### The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model which is made up of many communication protocols that are used to connect network devices on the internet and this can be also used as a communications protocol within a private network.
#### The TCP/IP model uses the client/server model of communication, this is when a client is given a service that is from another computer that is located on the same network. This model is made up of different protocols which are divided into four layers:

#### Application - This layer is responsible for providing network services to applications. High-level protocols that are included within the application layer, such as DNS, HTTP, FTP, etc.
#### Transport - The transport layer maintains the end-to-end communications within a network. The communications between each of the hosts are handled within this layer. Flow control, multiplexing and reliability are also maintained by the transport layer. Two protocols that are used within this layer are TCP and UDP. TCP is used for delivery of the data successfully and for providing error control, and UDP is used for less extensive control features.
#### Internet - The internet layer also known as the network layer, packs the data into data packets and routes it to the correct device on the network. These packets that are sent acroos then form the IP. These contain the source and destination address that is used to transmit the IPs across networks.
#### Network Access - The final layer is known as the Network Access Layer, that combines the data link and physical layers from the OSI model. It provides a means for the data to be delivered to other devices on a network and defines how the network should transmit an IP. This layer has to understand the details of the underlying network before it can format the data being transmitted.
## OSI Model
#### Application - The application layer in the OSI model is a means for applications to receive network services, basically communicating the services to them such as file transfers and e-mails. Numerous protocols are used within this layer, such as HTTP for web based languages transferred across the network and mail services by the SMTP protocol for email services.
#### Presentation - The presentation layer is used for interpreting the data and then transforming that the application layer can use it later on. Many file types are represented by the application and can be converted, encrypted, decrypted or compressed.
#### Session - The session layer establishes connections between applications and can set up, coordinate and terminate the conversations that happens between them. The protocols used are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol), which are commonly provided within most applications.
#### Transport - This layer provides the transportation of data between hosts or end systems and is responsible for error recovery and flow control. TCP and UDP protocols, used in the session layer, provide these services through the internet for most applications.
#### Network - The network layer handles the addressing and routing of data, where it is sent to the correct destination, selecting the appropriate routes and forwarding the data to the transport layer. The protocols that map to the OSI network include the IP protocol from the TCP/IP model, both IPv4 and IPv6, as well as Interwork Packet Exchange (IPX).
#### Data Link - The data link layer is responsible for encoding the data prior to the transmission and decoding the data back into the bits at the destination, mainly handling the data transfer out of a physical link. This layer divides itself into two sub-layers; Media Access Control which is how the computer gains access to the data and the permission to transfer said data, and the Logical Link Control which controls the frame synchronisation, flow control and error checking.
#### Physical - The last layer is the physical layer that conveys the bit stream across the network. This is done via electrical impulse, light or a radio signal. A variety of devices and mediums are covered, through cables, cards and other ports.

## Working standards and Protocols

### Physical Cabling and Data Transmission
### IEEE 802.3
#### IEEE 802.3 which is the standard used for Ethernet. This standard is used to determine the physical connection within a local area network (LAN), this can also be used within (WAN) set-ups. This is of course maintained by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The communication standards for ethernet connections and cables are updated regularly adding additional features however 802.3 was the first IEEE standard to be implemented. This standard is essentially specifying the physical cables and the working characteristics of Ethernet. The speeds of these connections that are described on this standard must be at speed of 10Mbps.

### IEEE 802.7
#### This standard is a sub-standard of the IEEE 802 which is recommended for broadband LAN connections. The items that are specified with the standard are the design, installation and the test parameters for the broadband cable medium that is used within the network.

### IEEE 802.8
#### The IEEE 802.8 standard which is referred to the standard of fibre optic connections is used in token passing computer networks. This is used in the same group as the previous standards and has some of the defining features within. This essentially gives the recommendations for configuration and testing of fibre optic however is called a standard by itself as it covers a different connection type.

### IEEE 802.11
#### IEEE 802.11 is referred to the set of standards that define communication in wireless connections. This includes the most popular form of connection Wi-Fi and is used mainly as a set of guidelines that is for implementing Wi-Fi to a network. This standard is used to outline the types of frequencies that are being used when using access points and other network devices.

### Routed Protocols
#### Routed protocols are protocols that are used to route data from one network to another. These protocols have an addressing system that is used to address a particular network or host. 

#### IPv4 which was one of the core protocols within standard-based interworking methods on the internet. This IP version 4 was thought to have enough addresses but due to the population of the world which has drastically increased and the amount of devices that have been manufactured for more actives users, which then meant that there was not enough IPv4 addresses to assign. IPv6 which was introduced to create considerable amount of addresses to fulfil the requirement needed which has more than 4 billion which IPv4 had. Global Unicast which is a feature in IPv6 that is a routable address that can be used on the internet that uses a single node. The main problem with global unicast is that when the data packets are sent they are not actually sent to one target destination. When the data packet that is supposed to be sent off to a single destination, is then sent to all hosts as a broadcast packet making this protocol a potential security risk.

#### Link local is an IPv6 unicast address that is only effective for communications within the link or the broadcast domain where the host is connected. This address is not unique beyond a single link and routers cannot forward the packets that have a link-local address. A Unique Local Address (ULA) is an address that is used in IPv6 as an identifier. The only problem is that data is not meant to be routed outside of the specified range and should not be allocated by an address registry. The EUI 64 (Extended Unique Identifier) which is a format that allows a host to automatically assign itself a unique 64-bit IPv6 interface identifier, which eliminates the need to manually configure the IP or to used DHCP in IPv4 addresses. This is a benefit of IPv6's over IPv4 is the capability for automatic interface addressing. The problem that appears from using this that privacy loss would be a potential concern, with the MAC address of the router being revealed. Auto-configuration is another important features in IPv6 that allows devices to automatically configure themselves and to use the internet without requiring any DHCP support making it good for applications to require a secure connection without the DHCP server. 

## Services and network applications: 
### FTP
#### File transfer protocol or FTP, is a protocol that focuses on transmitting files between two networks over TCP/IP. This type of protocol relies of two communication channels which is a server and a client who is then able to edit multiple files using FTP, the client is also able to upload, download and delete files on the server. In order to use FTP there must be some servers that can be logged into in order to gain access to the files transferred.

### HTTP
#### Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP is the protocol that is used by the World Wide Web. This protocol governs the actions in which web servers or browsers should take in from the user's commands in order to respond. HTTP is used to display the webpage to the user and provide with the visual representation of that webpage, and also helps handle the display and format to allow a much faster load time. 

### SMTP
#### SMTP or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, which is a protocol that us used for emailing messages to other users on different servers. This protocol is used to connect servers that allows messages that clients can send from one to another.

### POP3
#### POP3 or Post Office Protocol, is a protocol in which allows clients to receive emails. The most recent version is POP3 in which the email is held for the user by the internet server and once the mail is downloaded, it can be deleted, though it can still be saved for a period of time. This protocol has many updates and within each of the updates it allows more features to make it much easier to handle emails for the clients and easier in receiving emails.

### SSL
#### Secure Sockets Layer or SSL, is a security technology standard that allows encrypted linking between web servers and browsers. This standard ensures that the more sensitive data is transmitted securely, this includes information such as credit card numbers, account credentials.

## The Impact of networking topology, communication and bandwidth
### Network Topology
#### Network topolgies are the rules by which different networks are designed. Logical topologies are concepts that specify the architecture of the communication of nodes in a network. The topology of a network can be dynamically maintained and reconfigured by routers and switches. This is mainly specifying on how the signals act on the network media and how the data passes through the network to the devices. Ethernet is a good example that is based on a type of logical topology which is known as the bus topology.

#### The physical topology assigns to the actual structure of a Local Area Network. This ustilises various network cables that then are connected to the physical devices that are on the network. This physically lays it out for the organisation of a network. This usually requires a lot of planning by determining the cable to be used and how they it runs through the building.

#### 1. The mesh topology, this is where multiple connections are made between multiple systems and are all connected to each system that is on the network, this means that if one fails the other systems will use different routes on the network to connect to another system.

#### 2. The ring topology, this is where all the systems in the network have been arranged into a circular formation. This means that each devices is connected to two other devices on the network the data packets travel around these systems until it reaches its destination. 

#### 3. The star topology, this topology is where all the machines are connected to a single hub or sometimes a switch at the center of the network. This is why it has the name star network, as the connections branch out to give the look of a star. So if the central hub fails no systems can communicate with one another.

#### 4. The bus topology, is a common topology where every single component within the network are all connected on a straight line and are terminated on both end. This creates a stress on the single connecting line as most files would be transmitted through that line which will be a heavy load.

#### 5. A tree topology is a combination of a star network topology and a bus topology. In a tree topology, nodes of the underlying bus network topology are replaced with a complete star topology which then creates a tree like topology.


## Network Communication
## Network Bandwidth

#### Communication is the transmission of data from one system to another, this can be a mobile device or a computer, the transmission is usually over a network set-up by a company. When browsing the internet the most common process that is used is data transmission between the user and the server, for example, sending an email to another user or retrieving a file from the internet. However if a user would want use the internet, then they would have to acquire a connection that will allow them to use the internet. Devices such as a router or a modem are used to connect to a network, this then allows the communication with the internet.

#### Data is transmitted all the time through networks, but this data flowing through can be vulnerable to malicious attacks from hackers that try to gain information from users. Security measures must be put into place such as firewalls or anti-virus software into a network. This then protects the network from any types of attacks, so the firewall will stop any file that does not belong within the network trying to gain access but also if one does get through the anti-virus software will prevent the malicious attack from spreading around and damaging the network.

#### Communication also happens within a network model, for example, TCP/IP model has an application layer which allows services to be requested from a user to the application. This means that the data is ready to be sent, but waits as the communication is not focused in this layer but instead the transport and internet layer. The transport layer handles the communication between each of the host so that there will be a successful delivery between then. The internet layer sends this data across to the correct host and not to other hosts that may be requesting the same service. Each of these layers aid the communication of data successfully by having the data transfer mointored and to make sure that the communication is with the correct host. All communication channels within any networking model have limited frequency bandwidth, these limited frequencies are down to the properties of the channel so that it may prevent any interference from other sources. Since the frequencies are limited the bandwidth cannot be maximised to its full potential and can cause problems, for example when having low bandwidth it can reduce speed in both browsning and downloading/uploading, making a huge congestion of data being blocked.
